The original purpose why this was done on the previous report, was to verify if it is possible to predict the outcome of a match using the composition of the team.\r\n\r\nThe tests were done on Apache Spark 1.4.0, using the Python API.\r\n\r\nThe original analysis can be found here: [PvP in Guild Wars 2: A data analysis](http://juandes.github.io/GW2PvPAnalysis/)\r\n\r\n## Dataset\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe dataset used is made of 238 team compositions, taken from 119 matches done in Conquest (Guild Wars 2). The file is made of 6 columns; the first five columns represent the five members of the team and the sixth one is the outcome of the match.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n***\r\n\r\nOn the previous analysis, the classification error of the random forest model on the test set, was 52.63%. On Spark, the classification error of the model was 47.30%. The naive Bayes classifier also showed a smaller error in comparison with the previous test. Previously, the classification error was 57.89% and the model done in Spark, reported an error of 54.05%.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summarize, both models showed a smaller classification error on Spark. However, to obtain a more fair comparison, the proper thing would be to perform several tests both in R and Spark, get the averages and compare them.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
